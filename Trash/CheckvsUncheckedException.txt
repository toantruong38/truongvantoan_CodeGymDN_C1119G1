In java, there are two types of exceptions:
1.Checked: are the exceptions that are checked at compile time.
If some code within a method throws a checked exception,then the method must 
either handle the exception or it must specify the exception using 
throws keyword.

2.Unchecked: are the exceptions that are not checked at compiled time.It is up to
programmers to be civilized, and specify or catch the exceptions.
In java exceptions under Error and RuntimeException classes are unchecked 
exceptions,everything else under throwable is checked.
