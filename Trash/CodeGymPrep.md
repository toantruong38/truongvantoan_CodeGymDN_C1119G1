Java:
-Introduce
-JVM
-JDK
-Framework
-Class,overriding,overloading
-access modifier,static
-constructor
-package
-OOP def
-inherit
-4 rules of OOP
-base class,sub class
-abstract and interface
-data structures
==============================================
(1) JVM(Java virtual machine) 
runtime engine to run java applications
call main method
part of JRE(java runtime environment)
called WORA (write once run anywhere)

#process : compile .java file > (java compiler) > .class files(same name
w/ .java files) > go to various of steps > describe the whole JVM

#Class loader:(3 activities)
(a)loading
(b)linking
(c)innitialization
------------->
(a) class loader(CL) 
#process : reads .class file > generate binary data > save it in method
area > foreach .class file JVM stores following information in method area
1. name of loaded class and its parent class
2. whether(does or doesnt) related to Class or Interface or Enum
3. Modifier,variables and method information
#process: after loading .class file, JVM creates an object of type Class
> represent this file in "heap memory" (java.lang)
#note : for every loaded .class file, only one object of Class is created

(b) linking: performs verification, preparation and (optionally) resolution
(3 activities)
1.verfication: ensures the correctness of .class file i.e it check whether 
this file is properly formatted and generated by valid complier or not.
If VERIFICATION FAILS we get run-time exception (java.lang.VerifyError)
2.preparation: JVM allocates(size/buffer) memory for class variables and 
initializing the memory to default values
3.resolution: replacing symbolic references from the type with direct 
references by searching into method area to locate the referenced entity

(c) initialization: all static variables are assigned with their values defined
in the code and static block.This is executed from top to bottom in a class and
from parent to child in class hierarchy
